## Project Features
The project showcases a comprehensive set of features, ensuring a dynamic and enjoyable gameplay experience. Below are the details of the implemented features.

### Features
1. **VGA Display**
   - The game visuals are displayed using a VGA interface, providing clear and detailed graphical output.

2. **Spaceship Location & Movement**
   - The spaceship is centrally located on the game field.
   - Rotates within its axis controlled by buttons on the FPGA board.
     - Button 1: Rotate clockwise by 22.5 degrees.
     - Button 2: Rotate counterclockwise by 22.5 degrees.
     - Button 3: Fire projectiles.

3. **Enemy Dynamics**
   - Enemies spawn randomly at predefined angles (0, 22.5, 45, 67.5 degrees, etc.), with 16 possible trajectories.
   - Minimum 2 enemies on the field, maximum 8.
   - Three distinct enemy types with unique health levels and shapes.
   - Enemies move radially towards the player's spaceship.

4. **Shooting Modes & Dynamics**
   - **Mode 1:** 90-degree wide spray, lower damage.
   - **Mode 2:** 45-degree narrow spray, higher damage.
   - **Mode 3:** Direct linear shot, highest damage.
   - Switch between modes using FPGA board switches.
   - Visual indicators for shooting mode and damage dealt.

5. **Player Score**
   - Score tracking and display as enemies are defeated.

6. **Game Over Condition**
   - Game ends when an enemy collides with the spaceship.
   - Displays game over message with final score.

7. **Animations**
   - Enhanced visual appeal with projectile and enemy movement animations.

8. **Background and Graphics**
   - Added background images and graphical elements.
   - Dynamic background changes during gameplay.

9. **Visual Feedback**
   - Utilized LEDs and seven-segment displays for feedback.
   - Shooting modes, score, and game status are displayed using LEDs and seven-segment displays.

10. **Additional Shooting Modes**
    - Explored and implemented additional shooting modes.

11. **Leveling System**
    - Changes enemy speeds and health levels over time for increased difficulty.
